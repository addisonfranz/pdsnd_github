### Project Title
Udacity Bikeshare Project

### Description
This project explores bikeshare data for three US cities, Washington, New York City, and Chicago. It allows users to filter by month and day to view a variety of data about bikeshare usage in each city.

### Files used
The project pulls from three CSV files that have historical bikeshare data for each of the three cities. The files contain a number of different data fields, including start and end time for each rental, start and end station for each rental, and user demographics.

### Credits
The code is primarily based upon the course content from Udacity, but includes inspiration from a number of places to include python's documentation, stackoverflow, and pandas documentation.
